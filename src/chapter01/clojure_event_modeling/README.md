# Chapter 1: Why you should care

Event sourcing is about storing facts that happened in the system in the order in which they happened. In Event Sourcing facts are called events.

This means that the data in the system is like a story of what happened in the system. You can see the full history of how the system got to that current state. Having the full story can help with investigations and other business decision making. 

The big difference between traditional systems and event sourced systems is that the dimension of time is not lost.

In addition the events that are stored are defined in terms of the business language, so it's meaningful to the business.

Event Sourcing allows you to create a system that is easier to reason about.
